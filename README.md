# The-Abyss

A lightweight, Bash-based sysadmin toolbox for secure and efficient management of headless Linux servers. Designed for simplicity and zero dependencies, The-Abyss Sysadmin Toolbox streamlines server administration with essential utilities. Now includes the Abyss Vault for secure storage and management, with potential for more features in the future.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Zero-dependency Bash scripts for minimal footprint.
- **Secure**: Focus on secure system management practices.
- **Portable**: Runs on most Linux distributions with distro detection.
- **Evolving**: Core toolbox and vault are functional; more enhancements planned.
- **New Functions**: Added `--update` and `--uninstall` options for streamlined management.

```bash
chmod +x verify
./verify
```

## Quick Start

> **Step into `/tmp` or be consumed by the void.**

1. **Download the Latest Release**

   Navigate to `/tmp` to avoid cluttering your system:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   ```

   Download the latest release (v0.1.1). The `git clone` method is recommended as it provides the latest updates directly from the GitHub repository, which may include newer features and fixes still undergoing testing. The `wget` and `curl` options are for stable release tarballs, which undergo more extensive testing but may lag behind the repository:

   - **Using git clone** (recommended for latest updates):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/LordSodomiser/The-Abyss.git
     ```

   - **Using wget** (stable release):
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/LordSodomiser/The-Abyss/releases/download/0.1.1/abyss-0.1.1.tar.xz
     ```

   - **Using curl** (stable release):
     ```bash
     curl -LO https://github.com/LordSodomiser/The-Abyss/releases/download/0.1.1/abyss-0.1.1.tar.xz
     ```

2. **Extract and Prepare (if using tarball)**

   ```bash
   tar -xJvf abyss-0.1.1.tar.xz
   ```

3. **Set Permissions**

   Navigate to either the toolbox or vault directory and make scripts executable:

   ```bash
   cd The-Abyss/abyss-toolbox
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

   Or, for the vault:

   ```bash
   cd The-Abyss/abyss-vault
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

4. **Install the Toolbox or Vault**

   Installs dependencies, adds The-Abyss to your `$PATH`, and offers cleanup:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

5. **Invoke the Abyss**

   Run the toolbox:

   ```bash
   cystoolbox
   ```

   Or, run the vault:

   ```bash
   cadavault
   ```

   Alternatively, use the full path:

   ```bash
   /opt/The-Abyss/abyss-toolbox/toolbox.sh
   ```

   Or, for the vault:

   ```bash
   /opt/The-Abyss/abyss-vault/vault.sh
   ```

   > **Note**: If you ran cleanup, the `/tmp/The-Abyss` directory is removed. Use `cd` to navigate to a new directory.

6. **Update or Uninstall**

   Update the toolbox or vault to the latest version:

   ```bash
   cystoolbox --update
   ```

   Or, for the vault:

   ```bash
   cadavault --update
   ```

   Uninstall the toolbox or vault:

   ```bash
   cystoolbox --uninstall
   ```

   Or, for the vault:

   ```bash
   cadavault --uninstall
   ```
